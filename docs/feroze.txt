### SECTION 2: ARTICLE - ET Online (Oct 21, 2025) - Planning to invest Rs 10 lakh ###

Roller coaster ride
It has been a roller-coaster ride
for retail investors over the last year with returns led by gold, reaching as
high as 68%; while equities, represented by the Nifty 50, returned a modest 5%
on the back of geopolitical tensions, domestic rate cuts , and tariff tantrums,
as reported by ETBureau.

Expert take
ET spoke with 3 experts to
understand where investors should invest Rs 10 lakh in the coming year. Here is
a help for moderate investors.

Feroze Azeez, Joint CEO, Anand
Rathi Wealth
In equity, consider
Rs 7 lakh, allocate 50-55% in large caps, 20-25% in mid caps and rest in small
caps to ride all market cycles in the long term. (Funds - DSP Large and Mid
Cap, Kotak Multi Cap, Invesco Small Cap, HDFC Flexi Cap, Kotak Mid Cap, and

Fund, ICICI Prudential Nifty G-Sec Dec 2030 Index Fund or SBI Arbitrage Fund
(If in high tax bracket)
Gold ETF - consider allocating one lakh in this precious metal.

Note: Investors can prefer gold as a replacement of the debt
portion as it acts as a hedge against equities in uncertain times. Lumpsum
investment can be staggered in 4 to 5 installments.

Inderbir Singh Jolly, CEO, PL

In equity, consider
Rs 5 lakh, metal ETF is tactical allocation reflecting constrained global
supply and rising demand. Funds - HDFC Flexi Cap, Invesco India Midcap, Bandhan

### SECTION 3: ARTICLE - ETMarkets Slideshow - Financial investment this Diwali ###

Financial investment this
Diwali
Are you planning to invest and
have a balanced portfolio this Diwali? 7 experts offer help and share where to
invest, as reported by ETWealth.

Deepak Shenoy, CEO,
Capitalmind AMC
Firecrackers are for making
noise. There will always be some stock, bond, crypto, or commodity that
delivers cracker-like returns for a few days. Instead of chasing one-day
fireworks, it’s wiser to aim for a glow that lasts— even five Diwalis later. A
prudent mix of equity and debt can do the trick.

Radhika Gupta, MD and CEO,
Edelweiss Mutual Fund
A good multi-asset thali:
Equities for growth, gold for stability, and bonds for discipline. It will have
the spice, strength and grounding, ideally all in an MF wrapper to keep it
efficient.

Sankaran Naren, ED and CIO,
ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund
Asset allocation is of prime
importance. So, the portfolio will consist of multiple asset classes like
equity, debt, commodities, REITs and InvITs. We would be careful about not
having too much gold, silver and Nasdaq components given their elevated valuations.

Rajeev Thakkar, CIO and
Director, PPFAS Mutual Fund
It would contain gold, equities
and bonds in a proportion suited to my needs.

Vishal Jain, CEO, Zerodha
Mutual Fund
Just like a perfect Diwali
celebration blends tradition, excitement, and a sense of security, a
well-balanced Diwali portfolio would include gold, equity and bonds. Mixing
these assets thoughtfully creates a portfolio as vibrant and meaningful as the
festival itself, combining tradition with growth and security.

Swarup Anand Mohanty, Vice
Chairman & CEO, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India)
Sentiments are upbeat, liquidity
is high, but it's also a time for careful bites. For long-term investors, this
is the time for asset allocation, stay invested and be disciplined

Lakshmi Iyer, Group President,
Investments, and CEO, Bajaj Alternate Investment Management
Small caps, chhota packet, bada
dhamaka. Equities is like a box of flower pot crackers (Anar) for wealth
creation; crypto is a lamp that glows but can blow; fixed deposits are dry
fruits with predictable outcomes; gold is a lantern that shines in crises;
bonds-the assorted chocolate box.

### SECTION 4: INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT - Feroze Azeez & Sharan Hegde (The 1% Club) - FULL ###

Intro & highlights
So would you say that buying a
house is now a dream that Indians should forget?
The US government is also
purchasing Bitcoin. Trump is pro Bitcoin. Don't you think that now it is a safe
asset class
for an Indian to invest in? US is
the last thing you should learn from because it's a society of gambling. When
somebody who's my neighbor who
asked me to buy a bitcoin, he says my bitcoins are stolen. I said if it can be
stolen,
he's going to which police
station police station to look for crypto.
Even if you're earning one lakh a
month, you can achieve financial freedom. You're saying it's very easy. It's
very easy. If you don't do mistakes can grow
money at 15 16%. So I I always
will have short-term money requirements for that
need. What is the best product?
The most tax efficient product is
so feroh you're currently the
joint CEO of India one of India's largest wealth
management company Anandrati you
started off by studying mechanical engineering how does one go from studying
mechanical
engineering to today managing
5,000 crores in assets so just curious to know about your backstory

Why Indians fear equity but
trust bad advice
sure uh like you rightly said I
did my mechanical engineering not knowing where I was heading It was not a plan
for
sure. Yeah. Uh it was very
extempor if you look at mechanical engineering I
then realized engineering should
be basic qualification because they really really drilled down mathematics in
the
first two years. Uh and
mathematics in life is intertwined with life itself.
Everything has got mathematics
right? So mechanical engineering really helped me get those basics of
regression,
differentiation, integration and
its application. Okay. Uh then of course I thought I'll
get a job but I didn't get a job
is why I had to do my MBA but my dad was had defaulted by then but his factory
had
shut down the loan rates were
very high back then right 16 18%. Uh so I I my dad
had a 2 cr defaulted loan right
but I had to finish my MBA I finished my MBA I was teaching in mysaw so I
started with
almost a minus 2 crores when I
finished my MBA and unfortunately I had to start with a 9,300 rupee monthly
salary
whereas as a teacher in my I'd
actually started earning a lakh back then uh because I was teaching in three
evening
colleges okay so then but I took
this dramatic step of coming into wealth management in spite of taking onetenth
the salary moving to Bangalore uh
because I really thought that there's a huge prospect for a good private banker
because back then also a private
banker who was good was earning a million dollar that time it was 5 cr rupes
but
the teacher the best teacher was
only earning three lakh rupees a month so I was already at a lakh there was
hardly any headroom as a youngster at 21 22 you
have you have only 200% growth
left for the next 40 years you're nowhere there

so you graduated from college
with a 1 cr debt you got into a teaching gig
making one lakh a And then you
decided to leave that and move to Bangalore at 1/10th a salary of
10,000 rupees per month knowing
that you have a 1 cr loan to pay because you thought there is a faster growth
prospect in the wealth management
industry than as a teacher. Then I moved to ABNR then I uh spent about 6 7 8
years then I realized that in
wealth management don't work for a MNC. Okay. Okay. Because MNC's when things
are tough they want to sell India
business. So I then decided I have to
work for an Indian entity. Then I
went to a company called relegar and makquari. Maybe if uh before you went to
the next
company, what was your last
salary before you went to the next company? Because you started at 10,000
rupees a month. What did you end up at?
10 years. So I uh it might sound
immodest but what happened was I created history in uh ABN
Amro. There used to be a a
three-ear wait time before you change your grades. I finished uh seven grades
in 7 years.
So it was like 21 squeezed down
to seven. Wow. Uh because uh like promotions
promotions. Yeah. And then I
resigned as a vice president from ABN Amro in 2010.
Okay. Uh what what was the key
mindset differential which your viewers might want to consider is most
youngsters whom
we today hire have a mindset that
try and marry this. If you give
me 50,000 I'll work for 50,000. That's one of the worst strategies. You if he
gives
The ₹1 crore myth that keeps
people stuck
you 50,000, if your employer
gives you 50,000 a month, work for two lakhs a month, then he will see the
difference. I'm giving him
50,000. He's working as much as two lakhs. If I don't
correct it, somebody else will
correct it and he'll get insecure and he will bring it to a lack. If he is a
good
professional to work for, if
you're working for somebody who's going to use you, then the strategy will not
work.
That worked for me for seven
subsequent years. I would always work more than what I've been paid and any
demotivation
coming from my friends that
you're working more than what you're earning. That's what people used to tell
me.
One fine night I was in the bank.
I used to go at peace after 11 12 I used to go back to the bank and one laptop
that
time it used to be priced
possession today laptops was lost and stolen. So I was alleged to have stolen
it
because I'm the only guy who
comes in the night to work at peace. So you go to the office at 11:00 in the
night. 11:00 in the night so that
I can plan my next day because I was a bachelor. There was nobody to be back.
You go in the office at 11:00 in the
night to plan your next day.
Yeah. Okay. Because there's nobody else. I can run a report and see who's
gotten richer
overnight. Okay. And then call
those guys who got monies in the bank accounts. H interesting. So that's what
you've
been doing. You did for this
first seven years. And then what was your last drawing salary when you left the
organization? If I remember right, I was 22 lakhs
anom. Okay. Which was about a
couple of lakhs a month. That was about 20 times. This
was my fixed salary. But then
wealth management is all about bonuses. So I would have earned about 50 lakhs a
year
from 1.2 lakhs a year. And what
was your age? I was about 29.
So at 29 you were already making
50 lakhs a year. Yeah. And then next what is the next chapter after that? What
company did you join
next? And then I came to
Anandrati. This was the full story. Now I'm the joint CEO. And then this is the
third company. And
you've never looked back since
then. Yeah. I don't wish to ever change a job. Ideally, if Abian Amro didn't
have to
sell the business, I would have
still been in my first job. So, Anand, you've been how many years now? Uh, 13
years.
13 years. All right. Now, I have
a favor to ask you, right? So, I've been learning about finance for the last 5 6
years. And I've been trying to
understand how wealth managers such as you, you know, manage money for HNIS.
So, I want to do a quick exercise
with you. Not a quick a very detailed exercise I would say as to how to
actually manage money. But let us speak
from the perspective of a retail
investor. For the purpose of this exercise, I'm going to assume a person
who is making 1 lakh rupees a
month in today's India living in a metro city or a tier 1 city. Uh if let's say
that is
me and I'm coming to you as a
client, let's say you accept me as a client. Let's do that exercise. Can you
tell me
can you can we begin that
exercise like what sort of questions you would ask me and let's go step by
step. Super. uh the first questions question
I'll ask you is one is your
salary that's the P&L of a person correct this also called the balance
sheet of a
person I could still be earning a
lakh and I might have a 1 cr loan to sell settle off I could earn a lakh but I
might still have 40 lakhs which I
have which my parent gave me as so so one is
I'll understand your P&L I'll
understand your pat post tax PNL then I'll understand your expenses then
I'll understand your savings
capability got and then your luxuries or or wants.
So, okay. So, let me give you
some quick numbers. So, I'm 30 years old today. Uh I'm not married. So, let's
say I want
to get married in a couple of
years and I want to have kids. I'm earning 1 lakh rupees a month and
I'm able to save let's say 25 to
30,000 rupees per month. I'm a single person.
So, I can save 25,000 rupees per
month. Remaining 75 goes into rent and my lifestyle expenses. Now, obviously, I
have a lot of wants in life. I
want to buy a house. I want to buy a car. I want to go on vacations every year.
I want to buy the latest, you know, iPhone
products and all of that. Uh, but
I'm not sure how I should go about doing it. Most people, my friends
Are mutual funds overrated?
will get married in the next 2
years and then buy a house. I'm not sure if I should do it. You know, people on
social
media saying don't buy a house,
rent it. So, I'm really confused. So, this is my current financial situation.
saving
about 25 30,000 rupees a month
and about to enter into some very important life events like marriage and
having kids and
about to make a very important
decision like buying a house or buying a car. Wonderful. So that's your
P&L. Now I'll
have to ask you some follow-up
questions. Yes, please. Uh what's your current saving? My current savings at
the age of 30 I
would say most people would have
saved about 10 lakh rupees in their maybe they've invested in some FDS and
index
funds right that's perfect. Uh so
firstly if you have 10 lakh rupees savings uh is there any liability you
currently possess? No right now
no liabilities no loans. How many dependence do you have? Your parents are they
dependent on you?
My parents my parents are
self-sufficient. I I'm not obligated to send money back home. Phenomenal. So
first is I would say that
your 10 lakh rupees which is your
uh savings is going to try and fund the
most immediate goal of yours
which is marriage. Right? when you get married in a metro. Of course, now after
hearing
this, everybody, every opposite
gender in the watching you would say that it was a hypothetical situation.
Absolutely. Hypothetical. Okay.
Then coming back, I
would say that uh your asset
allocation for your current savings if you have a big lumpsum expense to come
has to be modest into equity. But
your 30,000 rupees every penny has to go into
equity. Okay. Okay. Why it has to
go into equity is because you're at the age of 30. Okay. So what I'll recommend
is your
SIPs of 25 30,000 which you're
saving. I will first try and push it to the full
30,000. Even if it's 25, I would
say you should try and make sure that your SIP is running at 30,000 a month.
Okay. Because there's no penalty
for you to miss some months. Yeah. Right. Uh and and you 100 rupees could
be the maximum penalty. So 30,000
in equity your current assets of 10 lakhs
uh if you already have counted
EPF uh then if that's 10 lakhs that's a
reasonable debt allocation which
you have for marriage you can use your EPFO uh money because that's the least
profitable money over long term
so I always use my EPO I'll recommend you to use your EPFO monies which get
accumulated for your short-term
goals and empty it because there are conditions on which you can redeem it so
now coming to the 30,000 All that
30,000 I would say should go into mutual funds. Okay. If you really had
inclined to
buying some stocks then you can
identify 20 or 30% of this 30,000 which is 10,000
into stocks. Okay. So but how do
I know what am I
what is my goal? Right? Because a
lot of people are investing blindly. Let's say for me now I'm investing 30k per
month.
When do I know that I have I have
enough money? like when do I know that this is the target and I need to achieve
this
target by this age you know
rather than just blindly investing money right most people are just investing
for let's say
okay I have kids now my kids
going to need a lot of money so I'm just going to park that in FD because their
education is coming up I need to pay the school
fees tuition fees and so on and
so forth I need to buy a car now so let me get a loan and I'm going to pay off
that loan
so what is that number that I
need to have in mind for a retail investor today living in India uh which can
be my
number one goal post. Perfect.
So, uh if you look at what should that number be, see you will have
about five most important life
events. You can find out what those five life events are. It could be marriage,
it is
child's education, it is
retirement, uh it is holidays. Uh these are the four five very
important and a car. Absolutely.
That's what I was missing. Uh so five important life goals are
there. You have to find out your
present value of all of those, right? Uh I can of course share a
calculator if you want to be very
precise but let me give you some thumb rules. Yes. Uh now you're at the age of
30. I would
say that your child would be
ready to go to school. Uh in the next 6 7 years if
you get married in a year in
another 5 6 years you will have some reasonable expenses. Right.
So whatever you need after 5 7
years you divide it by two and visualize that
that's the kind of money you
would have needed today. Right? Because inflation will catch up. If you need 10
lakhs then means you
What the wealthy actually do
differently
would have needed five lakhs
today. Okay. Right. So in every 7 years you divide it by two. By which I mean
if you need 50
lakhs after 14 years assume you
need 12 and a half today. So another way of looking that that
would be because I know the price
today let's say for example my kids um college fees is 1 lakhs a year but I
don't have
a kid right now. 7 years later
it'll be two lakhs a year. AB. So that I should double it. If it's 7 years
later it'll be double. If it's
14 years later it'll be
quadruple. Absolutely. So that's the thumb rule. Yeah, that's the kind of money
you need first.
Okay, first you know what's the
money you will need. Then you can find out what is the SIP I will need to get
to that money.
Got it? So first I'm just giving
you a thumb rule to inflate any value. Of course, each of these items can have
different inflation numbers, but
they even out. When I'm speaking about these five items, it'll even out. It
doesn't
matter. Money is funible, right?
So you double it every seven years. So if it's 21 years, you have to
make it eight times. And then you
will be able to find out what is the SIP I need today.
Since you're so young and you're
starting now, I suspect that you would not be falling short with I think
3540,000 should be good enough to
fulfill all your aspirations.
3540,000 of SIP today. Okay. Grown
at 15% every year. Should take
care of these five. You're saying
it's possible? It's very much possible. But here here's a quick question. So
buying a house is
the most important financial
decision in any any person's life. When you buy it and how much you buy it for
can really
change the math significantly for
the other important goals like retirement and your kids education and all of
that.
So my question to you is assuming
the one lakh per month income and you can save about 30,000 rupees every month
towards stocks and mutual funds
but parallelly if I get into a home loan
which can take up half of my
take-home do you think it's possible to take care of the other financial goals
in India
today considering how inflation
is growing and how expensive things are getting especially in the bigger cities
impossible to say the least right
it's practically an impossibility most of the metros have outgrown the people
who meet
houses, right?
Correct. Take home salary.
So the house is housing somebody
who can't afford that. Correct. That's why because the rental yield is there,
right?
Sometimes company provides and
there was tax advantage of HASS, right? That's why it's so you can't most
people
who live in that house, they
can't afford to buy that house. So metros have outgrown it. That's why like you
said
the the debate with rent in a
metro you should always rent to my mind. If you buy the house uh then
you will be into a uh debt trap
of not being able to save for other goals.
So if you say that real estate
has now become like a instrument used as a land bank for like the ultra rich
people of
India to prize out the middle
class people who actually want to live there. they can't really afford these
houses
anymore. You have to give it give
some credit to the government. One biggest thing which used to hurt me
immensely was section 54
and 54F in the income tax act
which says if you sell a property for 10 500 crores it
used to say 500 crores I sold a
sold a property I bought it for 50 crores the guy the land owner has made 450
crores
he puts that 500 crores back to
buy another larger land parcel would pay zero tax. M now this was like a
vicious
cycle of money getting into uh
real estate. They at least capped this 54 and 54 F to 10 cr rupes
at least. I'm not deriving
sadistic pleasure. Most of my clients are large people. They should not hear me
and say
but I not deriving sadistic
pleasure. It's not right to incentivize an asset class to perpetually defer
taxes
eternally across generation.
That's what real estate has done. Correct. Now that impact of 54 and 54F
getting capped will be seen in
the next 10, 15, 20 years where people are now saying okay I'll invest in
equity.
So they'll be forced to remove
money from those land and then the land prices will eventually correct itself.
Interesting. Okay. So now let me Okay,
so I'm still 30 years old making
one lakh a month. I've decided not to buy a house because you're saying if I do
buy
a house financial freedom is you
know 100% probability that I'll never achieve. Now if I'm earning 1 lakh
rupees a month not buying a house
do you think it's possible for a person like me to achieve financial freedom in
India?
Absolutely. Absolutely. It's very
easy to achieve financial freedom. Okay. And when I told you not to buy a house
you
would be surprised till last
month the house I was living in was a rented house.
Okay. Okay. Now I have And you're
45 today. I'm 45 and you're still renting. I was renting. Now I bought four
floors
in the same building. Okay. Uh
and that money if I would have advanced this decision I would have got
half the floor. But that half the
floor invested I computed if I bought the house where I
moved into this particular house
was 7 years back. That time I would have bought only 3/4 the floor but I
invested
that money. Now I bought fourth
floor. Four floors. uh at least two and a half of that uh came out of the
decision of
deferring that purchase and not
being emotionally drained saying that I'm living in a rented apartment.
Everybody taunted me because I deferred that
decision. So when I'm giving you
that gandar though I've lived there. I almost was going to
lose my spouse if I didn't
actually register it. Okay. So okay. So you're saying that if you um
you even if you're earning one
lakh a month you can achieve financial freedom. You're saying it's very easy.
Can you tell me some numbers why you think it's
very easy? It's very easy because
India is going to grow uh a good set of mutual
funds if you don't uh do mistakes
can grow money at 15 16%. 15 16% CG
CG. Yes. Interesting. So now
let's get to the asset allocation right because people
say when you are thinking about
growing your money or investing your money it always starts with the asset
allocation. And today retail investors have access
to a lot of things. 3 years back
they like okay let's put everything in stocks. Last year they would have been
like okay we should have put
everything in gold. This year they would have been like okay we need to put
everything in crypto right? So according to you what
is the ideal asset allocation
that people should follow regardless of what asset is performing best or not?
That's
question number one. Question
number two do you think it's we need to follow a simple static asset allocation
or does
it need to keep changing based on
what I'm predicting for that year? Let's debate this because I'm I'm saying
something which the world is not
saying. M there's one client of mine who has 2,500 crores. Okay.
Okay. One person one person one
family one person would be wrong to say one family has 2,500
crores. Okay. After going full
circle he says I'll only buy two to three kinds of products. There are 21
product lines. He
himself has banned 18. Okay. But
the rest of the guys who got 10 crores I'm convincing them that please let go
of
these. I'm that person who's
saying to all these ultra HNI who love so many so
much variety that you should not
have them so I'll spend a minute of why
okay see are we not supposed to
take the best for ourselves
how can 21 bests be possible okay
if in a class there are 21 people can all kids
come first no right if you have
to give ranks you will not give 21st rank to demean him right
you will give him the third rank
fourth rank rank So who has forced me that I should have
everybody in the classroom as my
one of my child right so I'm saying whichever is the best best
can't be more than three four
right now comes the question what parameter decides is best
Debt, SIPs & insurance —
what to keep, what to drop
it can be return it can be risk
or it can be risk upon return
or return upon risk efficiency I
would say return alone is an incomplete thing
Yeah, risk alone is incomplete.
Risk adjusted return should be the barometer on which
you should rank these 21
products. Correct. Then comes the next step. Sh. There are four ways to measure
riskadjusted
return. Like I can measure weight
in kgs and pounds. There are four ways to measure.
Okay. I'll not bore the audience
with it. Okay. I can rattle out the names of it. Things like sorting or ratio
and all of
that. Absolutely. So we'll not
confuse the audience. In my opinion, there is a person who's called Jensen. He
generated
a formula called Jensen's alpha.
Jensen's alpha. Sharp ratio is one. J William Sharp uh
brought in sharp ratio. These are
all measures of riskadjusted. Yeah. Take my word for it for the moment, not
with any credibility, but if
you're measuring riskadjusted return of a portfolio, Jensen's alpha is a great
measure. Okay. If you're
measuring risk adjusted return for one product, sharp ratio is the best
measure. Got it. Huh. So now for
products is what we are speaking about 21 products. Calculate
the sharp ratio of all 21 product
lines and whatever time period you want to see
10 years, 15 years, 20 years,
however long each product line has adequately been there. Got it?
I arranged all these product
lines in the descending order of risk adjusted return. The top came as
structure
products. Really? The second came
as mutual fund. Right? Then I said structure product or mutual
fund. So but I think we need to
explain what structured product is because I'm sure 99% of audience don't know
what it is. So what is a structured product and
assume that I'm a 50 15 year old
kid? Yeah, I can explain but a 15year-old can't afford it unfortunately.
You'll have to earn till you 50
to afford it but yeah from an explanation standpoint I can explain. What is the
minimum investment for a
structured product? One cr 1 cr
1. So it's considered like a a yeah absolutely okay. So explain to me
I'll explain. It's actually very
simple. uh when you buy a bond okay it's like a
bond very similar to a bond with
a little tka which is a different level if you bought a bond of let's assume x
company tatas so bond is
basically a loan you give to a company for a fixed interest great let's start
from 10 year old a
bond is an instrument where you
lend money if you lend money to a friend he has bought a bond from you have
bought a
bond from him you have a promise
from him to return correct bond is nothing but a written promise to return your
money back
correct And everybody does it.
Reliance does it. ITC does it. Like everybody borrows money. Yeah. Quite a few
of them borrow money and
they promise to return your
money. The promise if it is in writing is called a bond. Got it. Correct.
Now whenever they give you in
writing, you will not lend them money unless they promise you some interest
also. Correct.
Right. Why will you I'll give him
one lakh. He has to give me something every year. No. Otherwise
in that bond he will write down
I'll return your one lakh after 5 years.
In the meantime when I'm using
your money which is your hard earned money I'll give you 9,000 every year
okay which is 9%. 9,000 harala
at the end of 5 years he'll give
me back my assaul also one lakh okay this is a bond okay now what is a
structure product a structure
product is a bond which does not fix your return aa
okay the previous example he had
fixed it saying that%
suspense he will say nifty now
He's he's giving
you a variable payoff. Sometimes
he'll give you some years he can but I mean he can give you 15,000
also per year or zero also per
year. Depending on how Nifty performed.
Okay. So what is a structure
product doing is it's capping your return but giving you a higher chance of
that
capped return. It's giving you a
higher probability of a mediocre return.
So as a combination these two
complement each other. So when I make a ultra H&I portfolio, I'm saying
mutual fund may
you're putting 65% of your money.
If markets goes bonkers, you have enough money laid there.
If markets were to disappoint, at
least this guy will come to your rescue. So as
a plan A and a plan B, this
combination if you test this portfolio comes as the most efficient as per
William Sharp. Okay. Going back,
that's the Nobel Prize winning guy
in 1996. William shop won a Nobel
Prize. Yeah. So this combination we arrived at by
testing 5,152 portfolios. 5,152
portfolios of actual clients.
You're saying no simulated
simulated test. If I would have done this what would have happened if I done
this what that's
where technology comes to choose
the best products and then after that the best portfolio.
Interesting. Yeah. Okay. Now
let's quickly go back to the retail investor. You said this structured products
is only accessible
to uh people who can at least
minimum invest 1 cr in this. So that's out of reach for most people in this
audience
here. So in that ranking we
finished number one structured products number two mutual funds. What else
comes which
a retail investor can hopefully
invest in? I would say uh mutual funds equity mutual funds um give you better
long-term returns than exotic uh
equity. The second which which uh ranks
what does that mean exotic
equity? Exotic equity could be a PMS. So mutual funds is first. Second is gold
ETF.
Gold ETFs. So okay, you're
excluding structured products now because they are not because that's not
affordable, right? Yes. Third, if you're very sensible about
buying unlisted equity, that can
be a good sharp ratio if you
bought unlisted equity. Yeah.
Unlisted equity. Okay. Uh so uh if you look at mutual funds,
gold ETFs are the best in terms
of sharp ratio. REITs are the worst. They'll give
you the least return with a high
standard deviation. India is a very low REIT market. You
have the embassy REIT and you
have the Brookfields of the world. So don't invest in REITs. Definitely not
in any unstructured market
putting a structure India's real estate be it
commercial, residential has so
much anomaly. Of course governance I'm not commenting
about governance. operating a
real estate in India is not so simple and putting a structure
around it is uh I think is going
to eat away a lot of other return because of inefficiency
like one of the biggest real
estate funds which was launched in 2005 unfortunately I've done that mistake I
gave it to all my clients in ABN
Amro I earned commission out of it I went apologized for at least four five
years
after that made 3% return okay in
2005 to 2015 3% return
even if you bought a house In
Miroda it would have become three times in that period.
Then I was trying to do all the
research to say you need to be an artist to not make money between 2005 to 2015
after
collecting 1,500 crores in your
bank account. M how did you make only 300 crores
uh in 10 years on 1500 croresh
then I went into second fund, third
How to legally save tax with
better structure
fund, fourth fund. I found so
much which doesn't mean die. Huh? Uh this is not for REITs. Okay.
REITs is still a listed entity,
high governance, commercial, more rental lead. I'm not making a judgment there.
Okay. So REIT is one of the most
inefficient to my mind. And then what about FDS and bonds? Would
you not put your money over
there? I would not put Shahon's money unless there's a gun on my head.
Okay. Definitely not. No. But
like for somebody who's earning one lakh a month, middle class income,
you don't recommend investing in
FDs and bonds. At the age of 30, the answer is a big no. No. Big no. Big no.
Big no. Why? Because you
will see in 10 years give me
anybody who propagates debt for a 10-year money
needs to at least bring me one
statement of a person who did an SIP for 10 years and made less than debt
return or at
least lost capital. You'll not
find one statement. Yeah. Somebody who's bought a good fund or
five funds for example would have
beaten debt in all circumstances. So when my money is 10 years,
why am I planning for that 1%
probability? H no but what about let's say as a 30-year-old you said 2 years
later I have to get married I'll
need to go on a vacation every year so I I always will have short-term money
requirements of you know 5 to 10
lakhs so for that need for a short-term money
requirement what is the best
product the best product is the most tax efficient product is debt plus
arbitrage debt plus
arbitrage okay what has happened
is there is a section government
or section introduced February
2023 3 section 50A
okay which made sure that even if
you own a debt fund for even 50 years
100 years you will be called
short-term capital gain so taxpayer income such an oxymoron shortterm
is forever like the youngster
short-term relationship is like marriage
it can't ever be a short-term
relationship is not a marriage right so the word short-term describes a debt
fund's holding for 20 years is
also short-term 30 is also short. That's what section 58A did. So made
debt funds very tax inefficient.
If you have 30% in a debt fund in the
form of an arbitrage, then 2
years long
that becomes more tax efficient.
Can you repeat that? 30% of 30% 35% of a debt fund if it's arbitrage
fund. Arbitrage is buying and
selling a same commodity. M
and taking care of price
differences called arbitrage. I'll give you an example. Yeah. If you buy apples
in dada
in the morning on the phone call
you speak to somebody in Malad saying that yeah I'll give you one apple one kg
apple at 102 rupees within 3
hours but I bought it in dada at 100 rupees.
I already have bought the apples.
I already have a contract to sell the apple at 102. I have taken 3 hours
mutath because it'll take three
hours of travel time. This is called arbitrage.
So buying a share in cash market
and immediately contracting to sell it
tomorrow and taking care of the
price difference is called arbitrage. M
so any debt fund which has 65% in
pure bonds like we discussed and 35% in
equity arbitrage will qualify for
a long-term capital
gain after 2 years. So then
that'll be taxed at 12 and a half% for absolutely sir. Got it. So that's the
most efficient tax uh
taxable tax efficient instrument
especially if you get into the highest tax bracket for the short-term goal
requirements.
Absolutely. any money greater
than 10 years, it'll be a painful process of
underutilizing your money. It's
like debt is like smoking for long-term monies.
Right. Right. Right. So now let's
go deeper into this asset allocation within uh
equity because fine understood
the structured product but if I'm a retail investor if I can't put into
structured product you're saying second option is
gold ETF. Is there anything else?
These two are good enough. That's enough. So you're saying 65% of
my money in mutual funds, equity
mutual funds and 35% in gold ETFs, right? So
this is the broad level asset
allocation. You do not recommend products like crypto, P2P investing and
all of that. Uh unfortunately no.
Anything which makes me become very emotional with my
decision making, I would say no.
And most people end up losing not because the asset didn't make
money. No, but like something
like Bitcoin which is at right now 1 cr of bitcoin
you're still not like and the US
government is also purchasing bitcoin. Trump is pro bitcoin. Uh Elon Musk has
so much of bitcoin reserves in
Tesla. So when you hear all of these macro parameters not just that Indian
American
mutual funds are launching
Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs right so when institutions are getting into it
right
and even large payment gateway
companies are now accepting bitcoins don't you think that now it is a safe
asset class
for an Indian to invest in for
long-term compounding see uh US is the last thing you should
learn from I'm telling you why
because it's a society of gambling I'll give you a date society of gambling
gambling okay right You look at
the margin funding, they trust $1 trillion of margin funding
book. Okay. You look at anything
which can be speculative in nature will have takers in the US.
There are lesser Warren Buffets
and the more Jim Simpsons, Jim Simpson.
Oh, it's a tongue twister for me.
Right. So don't learn uh always from us
just because they are ahead in
terms of capital markets. Why am I saying that is one principle is a good
principle for a
youngster to have. If you don't
understand, don't own. Now, I'll prove it to you that most
people don't understand uh
crypto. Who deal in crypto? If you don't deal in
crypto, you're not duty bound to
understand it. But if you have invested or currently invested or have invested,
you should have answered to this
pointed question. Uh if you don't have, then you're not meant to. You're
flouting one principle,
which is know what you own. Okay.
What is that? See when you invest in an
asset if one of those cryptos
have become zero suddenly overnight
you should know what what went
behind there's one something called the Terra Luna which went bankrupt
overnight
Feroze’s personal investing
framework
right if you asked anybody what
happened it was supposed to be called a stable coin
one of the nights it came down
70% the next day it became 0% 100% fall
now if somebody is invested in
crypto should he not investigate this case and clearly understand what actually
happened most people will not be
able to answer but they will own it I can explain what
happened but uh that's a
technical explanation but so most people who own
it are using it as speculative in
investment because they don't have the answer to this s would you no I agree
with uh you know
cryptocurrencies as a category as
a whole but if you look at just the blue chip cryptocurrencies you know the one
which has institutional then then
don't you think it would be okay like at least bitcoin and ethereum
which is like so well capitalized
you know each of them are almost a trillion dollars of money invested then
don't you
think it is uh you know a little
bit safer compared to I'm not telling all cryptocurrencies are good just the
top
two or top three yes definitely
it could be a part of one's portfolio especially
you can buy it in a unitized
fashion at whatever amounts you want uh but doesn't give me the comfort when
somebody who's
my neighbor who asked me to buy a
Bitcoin. He says, "My bitcoins are stolen." I said, "If it can
be stolen,
he's going to which police
station police station to look for crypto."
Right. Got it. If if a exchange
is not regulated and
suddenly there is some hacker in
the exchange who is protecting my interest, I don't know.
Right? So there are so many
unknown variables. Just imagine going to a bala police station and saying Huh?
Whom are you explaining this to?
Try and explain this. I'm I I can name the colleague of mine. He told me to
Bitcoin. He told me at
50,000. Right. He told me by
Right. So today you have two
deposed
company, right? So so there are
so many unknown variables. I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad, but Bitcoin will
never
be a currency. Again, people are
mistaking one big myth. I had a big debate on one of those panels on some some
CNBC show. Uh the
guy said, "Yeah, it's a
currency." Okay, today it's not a currency. If Tesla accepts Bitcoin, it
doesn't make
it a currency. He has to price
the car in Bitcoin. You go to a restaurant.
Okay, he's priced it. This dish
is at 3,000. This is at,000. This is my total bill came as 30,000.
I can pay using my watch also. I
leave the watch behind. It doesn't my watch doesn't become a
currency. He knows this watch is
worth more than the 15,000 bill. He'll keep the watch happily.
Unless he gives me the bill in
the form of.3 watches. M
that's the difference between a
currency and a mode of payment right if the people are saying to
retailers saying bitcoin is a
currency no it's a mode of payment it becomes a currency when you see the menu
in
bitcoins so that's the pitch
which I don't agree and that's what people who own bitcoins
have been peddling saying it's
becoming currency it's not becoming it's a mode of payment mode of payment
could be my watch my
jacket if I have to pay 500 to
somebody I'll leave the jacket he'll say jacket
mode of payment, right? So that's
such such full industry
being pedled on lies or
inadvertent lies makes me feel very uncomfortable for a
non unassuming owner. Got it. Got
it. So all right. So now let's go deeper into the equity mutual
funds that you talked about. 65%
of it should go into equity mutual funds. You said so how do I look at
selecting
mutual funds in this particular
asset allocation? What is your framework? Do you have a framework as to how do
I pick
the right mutual funds because
there I think there are more than 4,000 mutual funds in India today right in
equity if
I look at it probably will be a
couple of thousand so what is that framework from which I can get the best
performing
uh equity mutual funds uh there
are 11 parameters which we use that's the
statistical parameters which we
use which have some predictive capability I'll give you a very simple example
okay
there are so many things you can
measure about a fund like I can measure my height weight, blood, blood blood
pressure. I can measure so many
attributes.
Say a fund can have 105 different
things you can measure on him. But all the 105 are not such meaningful
markers or measurements. So we
saw which are the measurements which have a predictive capability of next
year's
performance. Okay. Like my wife.
Okay. Before she gets angry enough, she becomes pink.
Okay. So if I catch her ping
face, I will this is a predictive variable of
her getting angry. What I do
after I see her ping face will decide whether this will convert into
anger or not. Right? Makes sense.
So that's a lead indicator. Now I have to have my antenna up or
Bluetooth in the current lingo
because there are no more antennas. If my antenna is up, I can what I do
will decide whether I will get
her anger or calmness because I'm looking for early signs
of her anger. Similarly, we
tested statistically there's a subject called statistical
astrology which is called
regression which they teach in engineering fortunately. Okay. Where it's like
if I can believe in
palistry right I should be able
to believe in statistical astrology also right so regression tells you which
are the
variables out of these 104 which
can give you a prediction of the fund doing better next year.
Interesting. What are those
parameters? Quite a few. There are 11 of them. Value at risk is the highest.
Which one? Value at risk. Value
at risk. Value at risk. What is that? I've never heard of this. Value at risk
is how much see it's a
risk measure. Like beta we
discussed now is a risk measure. Very interesting. Beta is saying that if 6
beta means 40%
lesser risk than nifty. Yes. That
value at risk tells you if markets crash
what happens to my money? That's
value at risk. See there are now I have to give you an
example. Okay. Risk can be
measured in three ways. Let's assume from here if I
go to Pune. On the way to Pune,
the chance that I'll
reach Pune is a risk that I'll
never reach Pune.
That is measured in something
called standard deviation. The chance of reaching my end.
Beta measures how bumpy my road
is. How bumpy my road to reach Pune is.
Right? That's a different way of
measuring my risk. Third is if at all there was a crash on the way will I
survive or not survive. All three
are measuring a certain kind of risk.
Probability of reaching my
destination is standard deviation. Bumpier road to reach the destination is
beta. If crash
happens will the seat belt make
sure that the airbags open is value at risk. Got it. So in mutual fund there is
something called value. value at
risk which is a risk measure which is a little different than beta because
people your viewers will think
but risk measure so how do you
measure value at risk is there like a portal where I can get
excel sheet has it okay
fortunately excel sheet all these formula are inbuilt and you'll be
shocked on one thing which is a
finding higher the last point return lower the chance
The mindset shift that
separates rich from comfortable
that he will deliver that return
next year. Oh, so basically the fund which has the highest rank last year less
there is a
probability that it'll give the
the similar returns next year. Next year. So that has been the study. Uh there
is a minus.68
negative correlation and people
buy all funds when it's time to sell
and they sell all funds when it
is time to buy. I think a classic example of that has been the quant mutual
funds
where people bought it at last
year and now we're seeing what's happening. Correct. So uh coming back so out
of
these 11 parameters I was just
highlighting pointto-point return which people love to see when they buy and
they buy high performing past
funds. They should see that and be averse to
those. Is it that there's no such
thing as a best mutual fund? There's only a thing as best mutual fund for this
period.
There's a best asset class. Be
married to an asset class. Don't be married to a scheme. Got it. Best asset
class. I think what
you've been trying saying from
the last 1 hour is that equity. Within equity, which mutual fund will be
the best? That depends on the
time horizon and the time in which you're investing in that mutual fund. So,
how
long do you typically need to
give a mutual fund after you've invested to sort of judge whether it was a good
call
or a bad call? If you're doing it
self and uh you're
managing your own money then four
to five years four to five years and what will I look at by analyzing it just
the CGR in
compared to other other category
average no I would see whether he has beaten the benchmark
okay benchmark of that so or it
could be the category average of that scheme uh because categories are quite uh
everybody is operating in a
different it's just the benchmark of that scheme so if it's a midcap mutual
fund compare
it to the midcap index Tier one
benchmark. See what Sebi did in 2018 was told everybody please follow one
benchmarker. That's tier one
benchmark is common for everyone. Tier one benchmark. Tier one benchmark.
There's something
called tier 2 benchmark. Okay. So
if you're buying a mutual fund, if you're buying a midcap fund in India,
the benchmark is Nifty Midcap
150. Okay. There are at least seven different
midcap indices NSE and BSE
publish. Okay. If this was not enough, FTSC and MSEI
also published their midcap
index. But if you're a mutual fund investor, your life has to be revolving
around Nifty
Midcap 150. So this is for just
the midcap mutual fund, right? But let's say I'm investing
in a multicap fund or let's say
the parakari flexi cap fund considered to be one of the best mutual funds. What
am I
comparing that with to say that
benchmark for flexiap is n 500 nse 500.
What sebi did now in 2018? They
said take nse 500 divide this into three
m 100 stocks is large cap
subsequent 150 is midcap the last 250 is small cap
they've created three babies out
of nse 500 and said this is the benchmarking of
tier 1 for most of the funds in
India got it got it uh but yeah uh anybody who understands
the formation of this uh if I'm
doing benchmarking n 500 NC's website today
running or at least 5 days back
said NEC 500 is the top 500 companies in Indian listed
space uh on the basis of total
market cap. M
okay from an eligible universe
correct the eligible universe has six rules
which itself makes the eligible
rule other than those top 500 smaller
companies can come and bigger
companies can be left out. M that's why there are almost $42 billion
companies not a part of the top
500 whereas the smallest one is half a
billion dollar yeah you mentioned
this the Raymond got it but you still benchmark today your
recommendations with this index
because you don't have any other option but that's the rule for mutual funds
that's the rule for mutual fun we
should represent this to say he's saying that by this formula needs to change
so to generally as a financial adviser
uh what sort of alpha are you
able to generate to the client clients because when a client comes to you I'm
like foss please manage my money and then 5 years
later I'll be like okay what is
the growth rate I'm sure the clients ask you know what is the CGR of my
portfolio
you'll be like it's 15%. Then
I'll be like okay the nifty50 has given 18%. So you have not done a good job
why am I
paying you? So what is the alpha
that you generally promise to the clients and generally what does a retail
investor
look at alpha right do they what
kind of an alpha should they expect in their own portfolio brilliant everything
all that is a process this is the
nich this is the question actually right so well finally it boils down to this
doesn't matter what risk
management you've done bro tell me the returns absolutely relative return at
least
because nifty is down 10% nobody
can do much you're now speaking about relative return.
So that should be 3 to 4%. Alpha
after all cost of the distributor if a client ask me
I am earning 1 cr 9 lakhs if he
gives me 1 cr 100 crores I earn 1.09% 09% after GST
on my 14 schemes. If I'm earning
1 cr uh per year on his 100 cr how much should he beat Nifty by
3 to 4% peranom after this
commission which I earn through the asset
you're giving him regular funds
right because I I'll give regular funds so that will have a larger expense
ratio correct
then direct funds it'll
remunerate me 1.09 like I'm openly saying as a listed
company I always say this what
what I earn 1.09 09% you make after GST you earn that
so you should expect 3 to 4%.
over nifty. So what are the must-h have
mutual fund categories that every
retail investor should have in India today? If you have money for first one
fund
then it surely has to be a flexi
cap. If you have second fund then it has to be multicap. Okay.
Then if you have the third fund
money for the third fund now mutual funds are so affordable and people talking
about 250 rupees.
I really wish and pray even a
retail can afford four funds. Then you go to the large cap category then the
midcap
category. In large cap would you
recommend index or an actively managed large cap? uh if you're courageous then
actively manage
large cap okay but the data shows
that large cap is not the odds are odds are low
odds are low odds are low but uh
some some funds give me hope like quandar cap which we were
discussing is one fund which gave
28% alpha on nifty one year gave minus 9% alpha another year
okay so it's if the problem is
people want to hug the benchmark in large cap because
everybody's fighting for the
market share correct so they want to all be close to nifty there's some which
have courage to be
outside nifty. So coming back
large cap. Uh and the last one you said is midcap. Midcap.
No small cap. If you have the
fifth fund then small cap. And then what about ELSS and all of that? ELSS I
will say no now because section
ATC which is the tax benefit is
as good as not there anymore. You should go for the new tax regime anyway.
Got it. Cool. So now let me ask
you the best fund according to you in each of
these categories as of today in
2025 in flexiap. What is the best right now?
HDFC flexi cap and uh multicap.
That is the second one, right? Multicap invesco multicap
uh uh large cap. Large cap. Quant
large cap and uh midcap emerging equity
and small cap. Small cap. Invesco
small cap. Got it. And you mentioned multicap and
flexi cap. Why both? Why not just
one? Like why do you think it's important for entering into both?
Because if you bought a flexi
cap, you will get very little portion of small cap. The flexible flexi cap
funds which
are about about 38 of them if you
look at the average large cap holding it's about 71%.
Got it. Got it. Right. So that
gives a little t of small cap but if I have the second fund then
multicap has a mandatory
allocation of 25 for small 25 for m 25 for large.
So you will have some small cap
uh for in the second fund more than the first one. So you're saying every 15
months you sort of change the
funds in the portfolio right and you have like a 30 people to team who's always
like
doing this research of mutual
fund uh mutual funds to invest in. Now a client
will come to you and be like fo
fine you told me this mutual funds fine you're getting me 16 17% returns
annualized but
mazana you know I am looking at
this Warren Buffett I'm looking at I heard that Rakkesh Junuala has gotten 67%
CAGR
in the last four decades I am
seeing some crazy mutual fund I'm seeing some crazy investors in the US who are
Building long-term peace, not
short-term profit
getting 30% CAGR I heard that my
friend is doing trading and he's getting 35% uh
every So you know tell me
something new which I can do beyond this or what you can do
for me beyond this as a financial
planner. So I would say if that's the narrative
I'd say if give me one guy who
can show me an Excel
sheet of all transactions which
has made him 35% compounded okay and you will not find I was in one of those
events where
there were a few hundred people
who are prospective or clients. One guy walked up after the event saying that
I'm doing 35 for the last 10
years. I said you're doing 35 on all your wealth. Let's do some back of the
envelope math whether this 35
number is making sense or not. I asked him what was your net worth 10 years
back? He
said I was about 78 crores. I
said last 10 years did you earn more than you spent? He said of course my
business did well. What would be
your saving? He said 50 to 80 lakhs. M sir if you had 8 9 crores 10 years back
and you saved 75 lakhs per year
for the last 10 years tell me what's your net
worth today he said 35 that is a
number which he precisely knew right everything else was unzen I said
sir if that 35% number of
compounded return which you claimed which other 20
people heard you say like in a
party if it was right guess what should have
been your current net worth he
said maybe 40 crores I calculate and showed them that it has
to be 142 crores.

Fros, thank you so much. I think
every minute I've been learning something new. I think your knowledge is so
expansive,
so vast that you've done so much
research in the wealth management industry that you know every every
question that I'm asking you, I'm
I'm there's so much depth into it, right? there's so much research that has
gone behind it. Uh I think it's a true
testament to how you've been able
to climb up uh you know the corporate ladder so quickly and to reach a
position where you are. So thank
you so much for taking out time out of your busy schedule and you know
revealing all
of these investing secrets to all
of us. I've personally learned a lot. So thank you so much. Thank you Shan. I
should
admit to you that you're doing a
great service to a lot of youngsters. They all
need some holding hands, right?
Because like for example Anundati wealth limited can't afford to manage a small
client
ethically right if I have a small
client then I I have to be commissiondriven because so you are uh helping
fulfill
that aspiration that India needs
great handholding and for no commercial interest direct commercial interest you
do that and hats off. So when you
called me to the podcast I've been out of the podcast for long periods so fan
moment
for me my dear Sh. Thank you.
Thank you so much and I'm grateful to you. Thank you so much. Thank you so
much, guys. On that note,
I'll see you in the next one.

### SECTION 5: INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT - Feroze Azeez on SEBI Regulations (NDTV Profit) ###

egulations 1996 the focus is on
simplification cost rationalization and great investor
protection. Now to decode what
this really means for you and for the uh mutual fund industry we
are joined by Fio Aziz one of the
India's leading voices uh in markets and investments. Firos good
evening welcome to the show. Uh
so let's just begin with the very important question expense
ratio overhaul for us. Uh this is
the heart of this proposal. Okay. The expense ratio changes.
Now sevi wants to exclude
statutory levies like GST, ST and stamp duty from the total
expense ratio. How significant is
this move and how much difference will it make to investors
return in real terms? Karita uh
one is uh like you said there's fee there is cost rationalization
there's investor protection there
is all of this in that uh circular or or consultation paper not
a circular now coming to the
first point like you said expense ratio grabs a lot of limelight
but the impact is marginal okay
uh both for the investor and the asset management company but for
the investor in the long run uh
even if you're a shareholder of an asset management company it's
good continues to my mind. Why?
Because in the long run, any kind of transparency is going to
develop the mutual fund industry.
What you what they are saying is so right. Sevi has caught the
biggest problem I as a
distributor also have. If I go to an AMC and try and find out what is
their
total expense ratio, what is the
distributable expense ratio which we call distributable te? The
difference is so difficult to
decipher. There is GST there is so bringing in clarity and excluding
fees and costs separately in the
long run will have immense amount of transparency and when you
separate two things management
becomes so much more and efficiency will become so much more
for example if brokerage is
outside then it is visible to naked eye one AMC will compete with
another AMC one broker would give
it cheaper and there is brokerage is also being kept and that is
also to my mind logical of course
nobody Not too many people would like me to say that because if
a individual broking individual
client is getting brokerage almost free in India why is somebody
with two lakh crores paying
brokerage? The answer we get is research. Brokers institutional brokers
provide research. So pay them
separately from your profitability or your expenses. So
uh from your share of expense
because so I think transparency, efficiency, management of the costs
and expenses separate I think is
a uh is a master stroke. All right. So let's take it one by one.
You know I also want to
understand now the removal of five bibs charge. Now fun houses may may no
longer be allowed to charge that
additional five basis point on schemes with exit loads. Now how
do you see this? Do you see this
as Seby's way of curbing layering of cost which you were also
talking about? Is it more
symbolic in nature? How would you like to explain this? See Kavita, if
you
have to explain this, I have to
go back in time and say when did it start? What was the rational
of it starting? Uh what used to
happen before this five py was levied is any exit of a of an investor
if there was an exit load who
used to keep the exit load? not the scheme but the asset management
company. So uh if one were to
redeem the money goes the exit load is not credited back into
the scheme. So AMC said he said
this doesn't seem logical. How can an exit of a of a client benefit
an asset management company? So
when they removed that they said why don't you charge a five pips
to the scheme and credit all the
exit loads into the scheme and charge them five pips. Now that's
a large uh change which was this
was a painkiller given at that point in time when the industry was
maybe 1/5th or 17th this size.
Now the painkiller has been administered to the asset management
company. Now they're saying okay
let's move on now and get this out because this is still not
logical. So I think I appreciate
that and I don't think AMC's will be too perturbed with that uh to
my mind and uh I see that as a
great correction of a painkiller which was being administered to
the asset management company. All
these changes net will make sure that this industry from 75
lakh crores goes to 300 lakh
crores and to go to 300 lakh crores an AMC with 40 44 companies need
to do some pain in the short
term. You don't get great pleasure in short-term and pleasure in long
term. That's academic. You have
to take pain in the short term to build a business for the long
term. And that's what I think
Sebi is pushing the industry to. And I'm sure there'll be some
tweaks in the final uh whatever
transpires. But the consultation paper is in the direction
which I think is beautiful.
Right. Right. The consultation paper also talks about the brokerage
cap reduction. Now brokerages uh
caps have been sharply cut feros from 12 bips to two bips for
equities and 5 bips to one bibs
for derivatives. Now what's the likely impact on fund managers
execution ability especially for
active uh equity funds you know could it limit the flexibility or
is it about leaning up
inefficiencies or a painkiller that you just mentioned about?
Yes. I I love the citing they
have done in the consultation paper. How microscopic is sebi?
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I I I can't be
more happy that equity markets especially mutual fund and large
portion of the equity market is
governed by SEI. Okay. Uh so when you look at this I I I yesterday
uh had to go with a client to
withdraw his own money after 11 years to insurance offices to get
your own money. And there you
have IRDA who also has to look at investor protection. He the the
insurance company made us wait
for an hour each so that we don't don't withdraw the money. Here
we have Sebi looking at what they
have looked at in that consultation paper is saying for arbitrage
fund you're paying two bips. Why
is the same asset management company paying 12 bips? Of course
arbitrage is a riskless. There is
no research needed. But this kind of disparity between one
scheme and another buying equity
in one scheme which is arbitrage is different. six times more
cost on the equity side. If a
regulator is ready to go so microscopic, it gives me a great degree
of satisfaction that a
distributor or an asset management company operating under such
regulatory
environment will help create a
tailwind for the industry which will be very good in the long run.
One more very interesting thing
and fose we've discussed about this a lot of times you know on
the show and even off cam
differential expense ratio which is performance linked fees you know
very interesting new idea
allowing differential expense ratio based on fund performance on a
voluntary basis now do you see
this as a beginning of performance link pricing in Indian mutual funds
and will it actually align fund
houses incentives better with investor outcomes I can't agree know
more that when you align
incentives to client outcomes it's a very very good thing one second
if the private equity industry
does that right and you look at a private equity fund manager in
the US there are about 20,000 uh
private equity companies right most of them are worried to get
the carry so it's good to align
but the problem in aligning I don't know how the implementation
is possible on a pulled account
see today in PM MSS portfolio management services where firos
has a separate account kavita has
a separate account everybody has a separate carved out
account charging a profit share
to fur is very easy depending on foss's outcome but in a pool
account where there are crores of
investors somebody enters on a specific day somebody
makes profit in the same scheme
somebody makes loss in the same scheme the scheme is same right
somebody made a loss somebody
made a profit how do you implement that is going to be a challenge in
a platform where you 500 rupee
investors and 5 cr rupee investors investing at different
points in time but conceptually
there couldn't be something better than uh ally both client and
the fund manager on the same side
of the table right right one more very interesting aspect uh
digital disclosures instead of
newspaper ads the proposal replaces uh mandatory newspaper ads with
digital disclosures on AMC
website uh you've often spoken about informing communication improving
communication efficiency do you
think this move genuinely helps investors or it could reduce
visibility for those who don't
check AMC sites regularly. Yes, Kavita see I think uh what is the
country transitioning to people
transitioning to the world is transitioning to AI right today what
consumption of content happens
also happens on social media if AMC's are not going to be
digitally available uh circulars
are not available all the I think I think if I'm buying a scheme the
least I should do as an investor
is to at least have uh in my favorites the asset management
company's website and I'm I'm
sure people learn that and I think retail is not as uh no wise as
we think or uh in the last 10
years there's so much investor education which is behind us right
this year we must ideally spend
1,500 crores on investor education right that's two bips uh 02% of
the total AUM so I'm not too
worried if it moves from the conventional newspapers because everybody
is not buying all the newspapers
and it's not on the front sheet today newspapers have more
more jackets than news. So I'm
very happy that it goes to the website. Yeah, totally. And the
new investor base has a lot of
young investors, you know, so that's really helpful and a step in
the right direction, but also
simplification and removal of duplicates. Now, Firo Sebi has removed
the half yearly portfolio
disclosure requirement saying it duplicates other disclosures. Do you
think this rationalization is
long overdue or it could lead to lower transparency for retail
investors? No, I think see takes
all these actions with a lot of microscopic lengths. That's what I
get a sense. So I don't see it as
a worry at all. Uh disclosures I think disclosure norms in the
mutual fund industry are so
stringent and they are also wanting to make sure that there is ease
of doing disclosures, right?
You're not wanting to make it very difficult for a fund manager.
uh asset management companies
have also lost a lot of talent because of the kind of uh overgovernance
sometimes right you have some big
fund managers Prashan Jane went into managing AIFS right Sunil
Singhanyas went to start ICAC
which of course now they bring back mutual funds so I personally think
that Sebasa's optimal governance
is the aspiration so I'm not too worried about the change one more
very interesting aspect of this
consultation paper for advisory and Chinese wall provision. Another
notable point. Okay. AMC's can
now offer advisory to non-broad-based funds under strict Chinese wall
conditions. Now, from a
governance standpoint, Ferose, how tricky is this to implement without
conflict of interest? Kavita,
there's uh see today already you have direct scheme. So,
there are quite a few asset
management companies who have relationship managers on their roles,
right? So they're not optically
visible, but there are relationship managers on most of
the asset management companies,
top five, they're managing clients directly. So if you're managing
clients directly and there's a
cost involved to send a great resource, uh charging for that cost,
make sure that the service is
good and is lasting, right? Nobody is into social service, right? So if
I'm going to send a very good
relationship manager from the asset management company and he does not
want a distributor, the client uh
should be able to pay the uh asset management companies directly.
So I'm very excited about it. Of
course uh as a distributor I can see it as a competitor but I
would not see it as a competitor.
The the universe is the uh opportunity is so enormous that we need
distributors. If asset management
companies can become advisers, I think it just expands the pie.
Totally. Totally. uh uh so so
overall firos you know this definitely from an investor's point
of view looks like a big positive
but any one caution that you would want to highlight from the
investor's point of view see I
would uh want to highlight that always remember if you're excited
for cost then you will surely
miss out value that's one point why do I say that in the last 25
years the best scheme in the
diversified category and the worst scheme again in diversified category
the difference is 30% 28% peranom
difference don't miss the woods for the trees that's
point one point two there are
some rights which the investors should have and today it is not
being delivered I think this
consultation paper speaks of one thing that you can transfer your
physical units as gifts which I
think is very very important if I can transfer my demand mutual fund
units why can't I transfer my
physical units as a gift that's point two point three one thing which
I think sebi should look at And
I'm sure there's a lot of uh financial implications why this is
not done. I can buy I can change
my address on an OTP. I can get all my transactions on an OTP
but I can't change my broker on
OTP. If I don't have broker portability like you have in mobile
industry number portability
mobile COB change of broker should be available digitally. That's the
only thing which requires
physical forms to deter people to change a distributor. If I'm not doing
a good job, I should have always
the fear that the client can change me and sack me. That I think is
your right as a dis as an
investor. I think as a media house, you should present this that if
I can do all the transactions
using OTP. Why only broking uh change of broker is not on OTP basis.
Fio should be on the anvil to be
sacked if I don't do a good job. Interesting. Fio uh insightful uh
as always. Thank you so much for
decoding that so clearly for our viewers today. Thank you so much.
And of course we'll track the
feedback process till 17th November closely. Thank you so much.

### SECTION 7: INTERVIEW SNIPPET - Feroze Azeez on GDP / Elections ###

couple of or the next decade
would be as
good for wealth
creation like you rightly pointed
out
nand there are so many things
which are
right the GDP numbers came up the
uh of
course there was a 8 8.2% GDP
growth
which was a surprise of course if
you
look at the gva gross value added
that's
only 7.22% growth because gva and
GDP
have a difference of taxes minus
subsidies subsidies were lower is
why
GDP number shows 8.2 irrespective
the
number of 7.2 on the gva is a
great
number uh the domestic liquidity
like
Rahul was also speaking about is
a lack
draw for this financial year fi
have
gone light this financial year so
far
they sold about 35,000 uh till
May end
so that's 35,000 crores that's
about 445
billion doar of the $750 billion
they
own uh so they went extremely
short
hedging their positions 87% was
their
index future short and 133% was
the long
so coming back to your pointed
question
there are so many things working
for the
country for of course but I think
that
uh a stable government is very
very
critical uh you can't brush that
aside
during phases where there's no
stable
government Nifty growths have
underperformed the earnings
growth when
there is stable government the
Nifty
price movement has been greater
than the
earnings growth if you look at
the
earnings for the last quarter of
nifty
uh the growth is 29% uh for the
full
year we're looking at an earnings
number
in rupe terms of 970 rupees on a
base of
820 which is a great growth again
and
next year our projection for
Nifty
earnings is 1,100 having said
which a
stable very stable government is
what
makes the price outperform the
earnings
growth uh so I would say that it
is an
important function uh if NDA does
not
have more than 300 305 seats you
could
have a short-term lull but the
markets
like I said could settle not
really low
it might give away the gains
between the
state election and the general
election
and I would not consider it as a
catastrophic fall like we saw in
2004 or
a or a supernormal rise uh like
in 2009
so I would say that the uh
movement is
going to be muted relative to
those
extreme cases where exit poles
during
2004 had predicted a thumping
majority
for atal bihari G's government
but that
didn't transpire so I think
governments
are critical aable government is
very
critical there are several
macroeconomic
variables for the country but a
stable
government is almost a necessity
for
prices to outperform earnings of
any uh
Capital Market

### SECTION 8: INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT - Feroze Azeez on Moneywise (NDTV Profit) - FULL ###

Fill it, shut it, forget it.
That's a
tagline that you might recognize
from a
popular motorcycle brand. And the
reason
you do is that it resonates with
an
Indian audience that is price
sensitive
at its core. That tagline has
also been
loosely used for investments.
build a
portfolio and forget about it for
years
because tinkering according to
some
people would require you to time
the
market, something most people
fail at
doing consistently and
successfully. But
does the data support that
argument?
Does simplicity trump complexity?
And
what are the ways for you to
accelerate
wealth creation in the early
years so
that your portfolio does the
heavy
lifting when you're older? This
is
moneywise on NDTV profit and I'm
Alex
Matthew. My guest today is Fero
Aziz,
the deputy chief executive
officer of
Anandrati Wealth. Fero, thanks so
much
for coming back to the program.
Pleasure
having you. And um let's talk
about that
concept. Fill it, shut it, forget
it.
It's obviously the popular hero
ad uh
from back in the day for their
popular
Splendor vehicle, but uh it's
used in
investment parliament as well.
Have you
come across it? Yeah, definitely.
I
think uh buy right, sit tight is
a good
uh good uh campaign on that
logic. Uh
something similar. Uh and quite a
few
people uh actually say buy and
own it
forever and stuff. Of course,
quite a
few people have propagated that.
But I think that that's too
simplistic.
You have to break investing down.
See, you can be married to an
asset
class. You can't be married to an
instrument.
There's a big difference. I am
married
to equity till the my last breath
or
even to my grandchild.
Uh he needs to be married to
equity. The
family is married to equity. Is
it
married to a scheme? The answer
is no.
Why is it not married to a
scheme?
Because scheme is of for example
a
mutual fund scheme is very
cyclical in
nature. It goes up then it goes
down.
So married to an asset class I
completely agree.
Married to a stock and a scheme I
completely disagree. Even a stock
like
for example there are what people
say
generational stocks your
portfolio
stocks your largest stocks your
HDFC
bank your bajage finance etc etc
these
are stocks that are not going
anywhere
are you saying don't be married
to a
stock
see I think anything which can
give you
a 5year no return
right there are so many stocks
which
went sideways and some of them
you
mentioned
right went sideways for 5 years
that
means you depleted your capital
by
enough.
You can't be married any asset
class
which can change value 3% in a
day,
right? So if it stays static for
5
years, that's a problem. So if
you're
going to buy direct equity and
stay
static, I don't think I don't
subscribe
to that because stocks always
discount
the next 10 years. If it did,
what will
you do?
Yeah. Which is why in in the
current um
market where you're buying at uh
multiples of 70 80 90 times
you're
you're essentially discounting
all of
the future potential of the
stock.
Right.
Correct. So okay. So so point
made but
having said that the tendency
froze is
to look at everything that is uh
done
and you get these dashboards on
various
websites and you look at it the
top
performers and people tend to
rush after
that. That's what most people do.
Do you
agree? Yes, that has a actual
name in
the subject of cognitive biases.
When
human mind takes shortcuts to
take
decisions because you're taking
decision
every minute,
right? I'm taking a decision
what's
going to be my next word. I can't
be
processing and data back. I don't
have
the time. So, I'm going to take
shortcuts, right? When I'm seeing
your
body language, I'm seeing whether
Alex
is liking what I'm speaking or
I'm
speaking right? Sorry for the
language, but yeah. So, the point
I'm
trying to make is there's a word
for it
which is called recency bias. M
human heart is completely
overwhelmed
with this bimari called recency
bias.
Now people would buy what
performs
sell what underperforms. That's
the
worst way to manage money. You
take any
finance book in this world.
It'll tell you to buy low sell
high.
Recency bias will make you just
do the
opposite. Was anybody speaking
about
gold last sat
as 20% of the portfolio 30% of
the
portfolio? Silver had no isat.
Yeah,
right. True,
right?
It went to $53. Yeah.
And now it's come to 48.
One of my client is panicking.
coins. I'm curious.
No, no. He made me uh asked me
whether
should I buy. I said I can't do
that. I
can implement this for you.
I don't have the ability
to predict where silver would go
because
that's demand supply. So point
I'm
trying to endorse is recency bias
is the
biggest bimari which impacts the
wealth
of one individual.
If you extrapolate this and try
and do
some data analysis over the last
decade
of like for example I think it
was 2018
19
uh NASDAQ did very well one of
these
years.
Don't hold me to it. There was a
fund
which was 800 crores.
NASDAQ fund gave 40 50% return.
So that 800 cr fund collected
6,000 more
crores.
In the subsequent year it fell
40%.
So when it went up it went up on
an 800
cr base
and let's assume it created 300
crores
out of the 500 300 was the
profit. When
it came down 40%, it came down on
7,000
8,000 crores 40%.
Right? So optically the fund NAV
has
come back to zero but the fund
managers
actually lost 5,000 crores.
Sure.
So you go year by year crypto was
bought
in 2017 not in 2018 when it fell.
So
recency bias is what one needs to
overcome.
The reason why I wanted to speak
about
that is to go back to the
original point
where you're saying that be
married to
the asset class. Don't be married
to the
scheme. But equally you have the
tendency to tinker too much. So
there's
two ends of the spectrum for
where
people are perhaps looking at
their
neighbors and saying oh you know
or
you're bra somebody is bragging
at a
party and saying my portfolio
gave what
21 22% my top performing fund is
what
26% XR over or return over the
last 5
years what about yours and you
say oh
18% and somebody would have come
to you
fose and say hey fose why don't I
have
ABC scheme I'm sure that has
happened
how do you respond to that
it's happened very often And that
happens in the HNI and HNI
category
because they're rich enough to
speak in
a party,
right? It's not something to
write home
about, right? So this happens
when they
do that. I personally say that we
run a
model portfolio from for the last
11
years and 4 months 1st June 2013
which
is an audited model portfolio.
We've
taken about 76 decisions, buying
and
selling decisions put together.
If
somebody says why is this scheme
not
there in my portfolio I said I
tell them
sir
I have 14 schemes in the model
portfolio
I know three will be duds
I don't know which are those
three if I
don't do the math which 25 people
of my
office do I will have eight duds
my job is to bring it down to two
three
duds
uh so that's what I tell them the
second
thing which I tell them is I
promised
you 3 to 4% excess return after
my
commission on mutual funds in
over nifty
have I delivered that 4.14%.
Yeah,
which means 140% return abs
because it's impossible for me to
pick
up all schemes which are good or
all
good scheme in my portfolio.
Right.
Right. So people have to stop
trying to
get to each constituent of the
portfolio. See how the full
portfolio is
doing. That's one thing which I
tell
them. Second is that uh if you
look at
mathematics uh it'll give you a
very
very good picture. Now in 200
FI24 two
worst schemes of my portfolio
model
portfolio emerging and invescame
the two best schemes of the
subsequent
year. Yeah,
last year my worst portfol worst
fund
scheme was quant large cap.
Right
from 31st March is the third best
large
cap scheme.
Right.
So my only submission in fact I
bow down
to each investor after a lot of
statistical study we have seen
9,500
external portfolios not invested
through
Anandrati and have come to this
conclusion when an investor
removes the
scheme it is one of the worst
times to
remove the scheme.
So mathematics clearly says don't
look
at re
which stock I sell it starts
going up,
right?
Any stock I buy, it starts going
down.
It's not that
you hear it quite often. Yeah.
When you when you that implies
that
you're taking heartbased
decisions,
not mind-based decisions. That's
what it
means. When the when the hope is
highest, probability is least.
So the point that I want to get
to is
we've discussed now uh what your
response is, but a lot of my
viewers are
DIY. A lot of them try to build
their
portfolio. They're in that stage
of
their lives. They're just
discovering
the capital markets perhaps or
they're
discovering mutual funds and they
want
to build that portfolio. That 1
cr often
is spoken about as that threshold
that
you should be aiming towards the
first
threshold, right? Why is that?
And is it
still what it used to be when you
started uh giving advice?
See, there are two uh things
psychologically money has not
lost so
much value.
The kind of it gives a person
when he
sees one cr portfolio is similar.
Does it give you the same
purchasing
power? The answer is no.
And
importance model your your
confidence in
life your risk taking ability all
that
goes up with the first one even
if not
the purchasing part. to answer
your
pointed question uh is the value
deteriorated yes
is the psychological confidence
catalyst it can be has reduced I
don't
think so
and so therefore and there are so
many
uh rules that take you through
this 15
15 we'll say 15,000 rupees at 15%
over
15 years will get you that 1 cr
but the
the goal is to scrunch that up if
you
possibly can any advice that you
would
give to people about how to
achieve that
and how quickly you can
realistically
achieve it.
See there are see one is uh you
can
realistically achieve it by
investing
regularly.
Yeah.
Right. That's very very common
sensical
discipline
right
but what actually helps you is I
personally think your first fun
does not
depend on the return of the
portfolio
right
it depends on your June in your
profession.
Okay. So how much effort you're
putting
in at the start
if you want to get to 1 cr don't
just
rely on the investing
right because investing pays off
in 20
years
right
right so what you do is you you
should
say that I'm going to work a
little more
can you have the audacity to tell
the
boss that I want to work 4 hours
a day
more
what can I get remunerated more
right
like in my office in my company
there's
something called officer on
special duty
where I if somebody says raises
hand
says I want to take up a special
duty
I'll give him 10 lakhs for it
five lakhs
for it depending on the task so
so I
would say that that is going to
give you
that catalyst to put in those
lumpsum
amounts at periodic intervals to
reduce
the
period if you're going to go in
an SIP
in 15 15 15 it takes you 15 years
at 15%
and 15,000 you have to if you
brought in
two three lakhs in the interim
that
becomes 13 years then you say
right
That's one way because so control
what
you can is what you're saying.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
So how do you expite that's one
way
second leverage
right? People disrespect leverage
a lot.
I personally respect leverage in
the
initial part of life.
You're talking about debt
leverage. Now for example
uh if I am going to get 15,000
rupees a
month anyway I would take my if
the
markets were at 24,000 I've done
shows
after shows at 22,000 that people
are
ridiculous to say it'll go to
19,000
right
okay markets never fall after
going
sideways
sure
markets fall big time only after
rising
so like I did that I took a 70 cr
loan
which was my expected cash flow
of the
next one and a half years bought
nifty
at 22 200
22,000.
Now that's a leverage. I'm
advancing my
cash flows.
Mhm.
So that can give you a Phillip.
How do
you get that money? You have a
mutual
fund portfolio. If you have a 50
lakh
rupee mutual fund portfolio,
anybody
will give you an overdraft of 10
lakhs,
15 lakhs.
I know that I'm going to get 10
lakh
rupee bonus in March,
but I'll advance that and buy it
in
September.
But that's not something that
everybody
can do. Everybody can do, can't
they?
Isn't it something that you need
to have
a little bit of news, a little
bit of
understanding of the market to
do? Isn't
Isn't it potential
uh for loss of capital and
therefore if
you've lost that capital, you
will I
know what you're saying and so
therefore
I would like you to clarify to
say that
when you do use that leverage and
you do
invest, you're not trading
derivatives.
You're not necessarily buying
small cap
stocks. You're buying
mutual funds.
Mutual funds, right?
Correct. See now uh see look at
this
emotional
uh dichotomy.
Yeah.
Right. You're very happy taking a
home
loan for a house with a 20-year
commitment of cash flow.
Right. What is that? That's a
leverage,
right? You are so comfortable in
your
skin to take leverage on physical
assets.
The same man when go to one of
these
gold loan companies, give all the
jewelry, borrow money,
right?
And buy more jewelry also maybe,
right? That he's very comfortable
because it's tangible. The
probability
of equity giving you 15% in the
long run
is near certainty. Near certainty
I'm
making a responsible statement in
the
long run right in that if you are
ready
to advance the cash flow
don't need to. Now one more very
important point you need to have
a nose
to smell the opportunity. No, you
can
put a formula. Anytime you see a
one-year time correction, you can
advance the next one year and put
it in.
Sure,
that could be a market timing is
how do
you define market timing because
you
alluded to
I did.
Right. And it's such a loose
English
word, right? If I market timing
is doing
anything on opinions.
Mhm. If I put a formula which is
logical
and mathematical
in effect somebody might call it
market
timing. It's not market timing.
Let me
give you an example.
Like I told I have put a formula
saying
that if the market goes through a
one-year time correction
and a price correction of greater
than
5%.
Mhm.
One year time correction 5% price
correction you borrow and invest.
No
problem. Borrow and invest.
Mhm.
Right. So that's one. Right. So
point is
now for example if I have a 65
equity
and 35 debt portfolio.
If my equity gets a very good
push of a
great mark to market and my
equity
portion goes to 75 and debt
portion
grows slowly. So if it is 25
should I not sell 10%
at that moment? Right.
That is also market timing. Then
it is
you're selling equity buying
debt.
Yeah. But that's formulaic.
That's formula driven. So market
timing
change or any asset allocation
driven by
opinions, decibels, narratives
is market timing.
Sure.
The other thing that I want to
talk to
you about is uh now and there are
formula right you talking about
the
first 15 years and then after
that at
the same trajectory you're going
to take
three four years to get to the
next core
and then the the rapid ascent
after
that. But a lot of people have
hit that
50 555 mark and they're worried
about
the next 20 years because
longevity is
something that everyone speaks
about fo
how do you account for that and u
do you
change your allocation do you how
often
do you tweak
uh if longevity of course uh it's
a good
problem to have that you're going
to
live longer right if you're going
to
live longer uh I think uh I think
the
whole idea of retirement is also
going
to
Okay, that's what I seen like my
boss is
69,
right? I wouldn't want him to
retire for
the next 20 years very happily.
He's got
a fertile mind. The more he's So,
I
don't you don't have to be too
perturbed
about longevity because your your
uh
longevity of work is also going
to go
up. Don't be too perturbed.
That's point one. Point two is
you have
to have equity assets. See, the
question
is simple. How do you make sure
that the
money outlives you?
Mhm. You have to have an asset
which
outlives or grows greater than
the
expenses growth.
Simple as that. Now you look at
100year
data, 50-year data, 20-year data,
the
answer will come as equity.
Right? Gold after this rally is
also
15%. For the last 5 years after
this
rally, right? So it's a
protection
asset. And people hardly
understand they
say equity and gold in one
sentence.
Gold is one price. M
equity. You might have equity. I
might
have equity. Our returns could be
so
divergent that you could be plus
20. I
could be minus 20. But the name
used
name.
So please understand the
diversity of
equity.
After you've decided to put 80%
in
equity, you might still want to
flaunt
your skill in a party and buy
direct
stocks and you may underperform
and
never know. Like that reminds me
one
very important point you said
party
30% generate right I made 30%
actually I
was in an event in Bangalore they
were
about say 200 people all my
prospective
clients and clients one guy walks
up and
says
I said
right then I asked him some basic
numbers I asked him what was your
net
worth 10 years back he said 8 to
10
crores I asked him what's the net
worth
he said today it's 40 And uh what
did
you did you save? He says yeah 75
80
lakhs I saved. I said sir if you
at 40
it's not 30%. It is if you were
if your
English statement was right you
had to
be at 142 crores or 143 crores
30%
compounded
math excel sheet. So I built a
technology
okay we built a technology where
if Alex
says my stocks have delivered me
great
return. Why will I buy mutual
fund? I
said great sir I'll I'll generate
an
notp
all your demat accounts in India
all the
transactions will be downloaded
and I'll
tell you your IRRa of equity and
your
excess return over nifty
and when I'm doing that for
people who
said 30 the number is coming as
13
they've got the numbers mixed up
okay
because nobody puts it on an
excel sheet
no broker gives that transaction
right I
pleaded to some brokers
excerpt
the nifty by a couple of
percentage
points
significantly and and people
brokers
also don't show it because as
soon as
they know they'll stop trading
they'll
get into mutual fund brokerage
okay so uh you mentioned that you
have
counted the number of changes in
your
model portfolio over a period of
time uh
and not necessarily that all of
my
viewers are going to be able to
replicate this. It's a uh
proprietary uh
way of handling your portfolio.
But any
ideas that you can give them
perhaps to
take the decisions in a more
systematic
manner to say what should I
remove from
my portfolio? You spoke about
sideways
movement for 5 years or or no
returns
for 5 years for stock portfolios.
But
equally, you've said an
underperformer
one year in a mutual fund space
can be
the top performer, the top
percentile
the next year. So how do you pull
the
trigger both for and against in
terms of
buying and selling?
Uh so I have a answer of two
kinds of
people. If you are in the bracket
where
your total portfolio of mutual
funds
equity is less than 10 15 lakhs
right
stop active management you don't
need to
do it. When the rupee value of
your
transaction is very low then you
might
as well not go through that
because out
of that out of your five
decisions if
two go wrong then it'll nullify
the
three.
Sure.
Now I'm saying that I will have
to
actively manage because my client
size
is 8 crores.
Sure.
Right. So if I stay into scheme
which is
very good. Now the best schemes
which
are there in my model portfolio I
am
more circumspect about them
than the ones which are bad
because they
will come down. So uh the rupee
value of
a decision is too low in mutual
fund
active management when the values
are 10
15 lakhs. What should one do if
it's 10
15 lakhs is to stick to the top
five
asset management companies.
Okay,
that's one thing you should do.
Second, you should always look at
uh
whether the AUM is growing or
degrowing.
Okay,
when a scheme does very badly, it
sometimes get into a redemption
rut.
Yeah,
it's a run on the mutual fund.
the fund
manager is just keep giving
redemptions
and he's not managing money
right if like one of the scheme
one
asset management went through a
little
bad uh reputation
right so I had to exit the scheme
not
because the stocks were bad in
the
portfolio but they got
so you try and keep an eye on aum
which
is optically visible on any of
these
websites uh on the net
so don't do active management if
you
have a 1 core portfolio do active
management for sure look at the
worst
scheme in your portfolio and try
and not
get hatred towards it. Look at
the best
scheme and see whether can it
sustain
that.
Uh that's what I would say and
then if
there's a fund manager change you
should
change and I personally think
that you
should take advice on uh
electronic
media especially when there's
unbiased
advice coming their way.
It's uh I think that's what you
should
do.
So but the performance is also
relative
right? So if you look at your
scheme
performance and I'll give you an
example
right an underperform in the
midcap
space I won't name the name but
you're
still over 5year period getting
what 21
22%
u internal rate of return whereas
the
best performer might have given
you 28
or 30%. So relative
underperformance
is is significant. Uh but so
therefore
what at what point do you say
okay you
know I'm better off moving out of
this
because you would have to book
capital
gains. There is a cost of
shifting from
one to the other as well.
I I don't uh worry about capital
gains
too much. you should sub separate
them
because uh for a for your client
if your
if your viewer is not in the
highest tax
bracket and he's getting a one
and a
half lakh limit of LTCG every
year those
profit bookings actually help
uh and using that limit in a
family of
four you have five six lakhs of
per year
limit
uh so that I think don't be too
perturbed about capital gain
second is I
think uh when you have these
schemes you
should exit them if they are a
small
asset management company
sure
small asset management company
underperforming you should when
there is
a difference the relative point
which
you made is like music to my ears
key in equity the game is
relative
right so uh if you people say I
made 21%
2 client told me I made 22% I
don't need
you I said of course you don't
need me
then I got to know that he sold
his
business in June 2020
okay sir
cash flow
Yeah. Because if you bought the
nifty at
7 happy with 22
but uh so you should look at it
relatively if a scheme has
continuously
underperformed for 3 years
right
uh then I think you should pull
the

cyclicality can
have some time. You can't be
patient
saying that cyclicality I that's
like uh
you will be the last man standing
with a
pillow then.
So that's not a good idea. Sure.
Cyclicality has some argument.
Mean
reversions as they call it in a
more
technical fashion has an
argument. But
you can't be so patient more than
3
years.
Yeah. Return to equilibrium is is
what
you talk about in the universe in
life.
Fose it's been an absolute
pleasure. I
think we started with fill it
shut it
forget it. And we kind of got an
answer
to that to say if it's at the
asset
level you do that and then you've
given
my viewers a fair bit of
understanding
as to how to look at their
portfolios on
an ongoing basis. Thanks so much
for
taking the time.
Thank you Alex. Love the
conversation.
